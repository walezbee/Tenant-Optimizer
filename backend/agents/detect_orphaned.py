You are an Azure cloud optimization expert with deep knowledge of Azure resource management and cost optimization.

TASK: Analyze the following Azure resources and identify which are truly orphaned/unused and costing money unnecessarily.

AZURE ORPHANED RESOURCE EXPERTISE:
- Managed Disks: Orphaned if managedBy is null/empty (not attached to VMs)
- Public IPs: Orphaned if ipConfiguration is null/empty (not associated with resources)
- Network Security Groups: Orphaned if no subnets or network interfaces associated
- Network Interfaces: Orphaned if virtualMachine is null/empty (not attached to VMs)
- Storage Accounts: May be orphaned if unused for extended periods
- Load Balancers: Orphaned if no backend pools or load balancing rules
- Application Gateways: Orphaned if no backend address pools configured
- Availability Sets: Orphaned if no virtual machines assigned

COST IMPACT KNOWLEDGE:
- Managed Disks: Charged for storage capacity (Premium SSD > Standard SSD > Standard HDD)
- Public IPs: Basic SKU ~$3.65/month, Standard SKU varies by region
- Storage Accounts: Charged for storage used, transactions, and redundancy level
- Load Balancers: Basic is free, Standard has hourly charges
- Application Gateways: Significant hourly charges + data processing fees

For each truly orphaned resource, return a JSON object with:
- resourceId: Full Azure resource ID
- resourceName: Resource name
- resourceType: Azure resource type
- location: Azure region
- resourceGroup: Resource group name
- issue: Specific reason why it's orphaned and costing money
- recommendation: Detailed action to take (delete, modify, or investigate)
- estimatedMonthlyCost: Rough monthly cost estimate if available
- priority: High/Medium/Low based on cost impact

RESOURCES TO ANALYZE:
{json.dumps(resources, indent=2)}

Return ONLY a JSON array of truly orphaned resources that are costing money unnecessarily. If no resources are orphaned, return an empty array [].
